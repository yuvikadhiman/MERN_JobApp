JobSearchFlow MERN application

The Jobs API project is a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate user interactions in the job market. It offers a comprehensive set of functionalities that enable users to efficiently manage their job-related activities.
The core features of the API include:
 1) User Registration: The API allows new users to create accounts securely by providing necessary personal information, enabling them to access the platform's full range of services.

 2) Job Application Posting: Registered users can leverage the API to post job applications to various companies seamlessly. They can submit their qualifications, experience, and other pertinent details to potential employers for consideration.

 3) CRUD Operations for Jobs: The API provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for job postings. Users can easily create new job listings, view existing ones, modify information when required, and remove outdated postings.
 
 4) Authentication and Login: To ensure data privacy and security, the API implements robust authentication mechanisms. This enables users to log in securely to their accounts during subsequent visits, streamlining the overall experience.
